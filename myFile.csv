HTML: Elements,"Building blocks of HTML, defined with tags (e.g., <div>, <p>, <a>)."

CSS: Flexbox,A layout module for distributing space along a single axis.
CSS: Grid,A powerful two-dimensional layout system.
CSS: Box Model,"Describes how elements are wrapped with margin, border, padding."
CSS: Media Queries,Used to create responsive designs based on screen size.
CSS: Positioning,"Defines how elements are placed: static, relative, absolute, fixed."
CSS: Animations,Allows smooth transitions using @keyframes and animation properties.
HTTP: Methods,"Common methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH."
HTTP: Status Codes,"Examples: 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error."
HTTP: Headers,"Metadata sent with requests/responses, like Content-Type, Authorization."
HTTP: Cookies,Small data stored in the browser to track sessions.
HTTP: CORS,"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, controls API access between different origins."
HTTP: REST,"Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for APIs."
HTTP: HTTPS,Secure version of HTTP using TLS encryption.
